## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is essentially my first time building a project as It's been many years ago since I've made a website. I used ReactJs for this proect, I don't remember much css but I'm also doing [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) on the side, fundamental knowledge from the TheOdinProject is helping me alot in this project

I forgot how to center a div but essentially, this is how you do it.

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
}
.container {
    display: flex;
    height: 100vh;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
A very good habit to make box appear as you expect
```css
*, *::after, *::before {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
html {
    box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development
I'm still very new to this. But I'm willing to push on forwards. As there is so many interesting things to build. I'll try many projects from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
